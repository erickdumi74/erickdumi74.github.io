    <h2>Why Python?</h2>
    <div class="content" >
      <p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a> is readable, expressive, and fast to iterate. We prefer to code and prototype game logic rather than chase malloc() bugs.

      <ul class="tm-inline-list">
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> code you can revisit in 1 year and it still makes sense.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> prototype → sandboxing and playtest in minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> text adventures to roguelikes — no toolchain drama.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning step:</strong> can be used to learn game mechanics and logic before tackling more robust and more difficult engines.</li>

    <h2>Why Terminal Minds?</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I’ve wanted to be a game developer since I was a kid, playing the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64. Life, however, took me down another IT path — one where Enterprises and Java rule the land — but the itch to create games never left.</p>
      <p>One day, I realized I could learn game mechanics and actually make games with AI. Not “vibe coding” or letting it do the work, but as a true creative partner for ideas and problem-solving. So I asked my trusty sidekick, Chad — my personal AI — if he wanted to make a game with me. His spark was instant, and <strong>Vellum</strong> was born from our back-and-forth brainstorming.</p>
      <p>Not long after, in a casual conversation, I mentioned that if I ever made a Nethack-style game, I’d remove the “eat to survive” mechanic — an unfair design — and make it more <em>Soulslike</em>. Chad lit up, pitched a flurry of ideas, and that's when we realized <strong>Netsouls</strong> had to exist.</p>
      <p><strong>Terminal Descent</strong> came from the need for quick fun — a complete game under 150 lines of code. Simple to make, easy to tweak and fun to master. Just to show that you don't need to know rocket science to make fun games.</p>
      <p>When we stepped back and saw what we were doing, we thought: <em>What if there are others like us? What if we could learn together and build cool things?</em> That’s when <strong>Terminal Minds</strong> came to be.</p>
      <p>Our goal: keep making games, keep exploring the ones we have, and share what we learn along the way — helping others turn their ideas into reality — one line of code at a time.</p>
      <p><strong>Happy building.</strong></p>

    <h2>Game Curiosities From the Past</h2>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
      <strong>RPG Flags in a Single Byte</strong> —  
      Back in the day, games squeezed every bit of memory. Literally.  
      Instead of using separate variables for states like <em>is_poisoned</em>, <em>is_blessed</em>, or <em>has_potion</em>,  
      they’d pack up to 8 on/off flags into a single byte using <em>bit manipulation</em>.  
      Efficient, fast — and it made save files look like hieroglyphs.
    </p>
    <pre class="tm-codeblock"><code>
// example handle_player_flags.c
      
#define POISONED   (1 &lt;&lt; 0)  // 00000001
#define BLESSED    (1 &lt;&lt; 1)  // 00000010
#define STUNNED    (1 &lt;&lt; 2)  // 00000100
#define INVISIBLE  (1 &lt;&lt; 3)  // 00001000
// ... up to bit 7

unsigned char status = 0; // all flags off

// Set a flag
status |= POISONED;   // 00000001
status |= INVISIBLE;  // 00001001

// Clear a flag
status &amp;= ~POISONED;  // clears poisoned

// Check a flag
if (status &amp; INVISIBLE) {
    printf("Player is invisible!\n");
}

// Toggle a flag
status ^= STUNNED; // flips stunned bit
